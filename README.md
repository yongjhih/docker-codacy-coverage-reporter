Multi-language coverage reporter for Codacy https://www.codacy.com

```
codacy-coverage-reporter will only work with:
  * Java JRE 7 and higher
```

## Usage

```sh
docker run -it
           -e CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
           -v $(pwd):/src
           yongjhih/codacy-coverage-reporter
           codacy-coverage-reporter -l Java -r ./mocker/build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
```

## Setup

Codacy assumes that coverage is previously configured for your project.

You can install the coverage reporter by running:

### [Install jpm](https://www.jpm4j.org/#!/md/install)
```
curl https://www.jpm4j.org/install/script | sh
```

### Install codacy-coverage-reporter
```
jpm install com.codacy:codacy-coverage-reporter:assembly
```

## Updating Codacy

To update Codacy, you will need your project API token. You can find the token in Project -> Settings -> Integrations -> Project API.

Then set it in your terminal, replacing %Project_Token% with your own token:

```
export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%
```

Next, simply run the Codacy reporter. It will find the current commit and send all details to your project dashboard:

```
codacy-coverage-reporter -l Java -r coverage.xml
```

> Note: You should keep your API token well **protected**, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

## Java 6

Due to a limitation in Java 6, the plugin is unable to establish a connection to codacy.com.
You can run [this script](https://gist.github.com/mrfyda/51cdf48fa0722593db6a) after the execution to upload the generated report to Codacy.


## Build from source

If you are having any issues with your installation, you can also build the coverage reporter from source.

To make sure you are using the version that you are building, you can remove your previously installed version:
```
[sudo] jpm remove codacy-coverage-reporter
```

1- Clone our repository https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter

2- Run the command `sbt assembly`. This will produce a .jar that you can run in the `codacy-coverage-reporter/target/codacy-coverage-reporter-assembly-1.0.4.jar`

3- In the project you want to send the coverage, use the jar. Example:

```
~/git/codacy/java-project$ java -cp ../codacy-coverage-reporter/target/codacy-coverage-reporter-assembly-1.0.4.jar com.codacy.CodacyCoverageReporter -l Java -r jacoco.xml
```

## Troubleshooting

If you receive a `Failed to upload report: Not Found`error when running the command, then you'll probably have codacy-coverage-reporter 1.0.3 installed. Make sure you install version 1.0.4, that fixes that error.

Example (issue: [#11](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/issues/11)) : 
```
codacy-coverage-reporter -l Java -r PATH_TO_COVERAGE/coverage.xml
2015-11-20 04:06:58,887 [info]  com.codacy Parsing coverage data... 
2015-11-20 04:06:59,506 [info]  com.codacy Uploading coverage data... 

2015-11-20 04:07:00,639 [error] com.codacy Failed to upload report: Not Found
```
Even after doing all of the above troubleshooting steps in case you still encounter the same error 

```
2015-11-20 04:07:00,639 [error] com.codacy Failed to upload report: Not Found 
```

Please try running the command with a --prefix option with path to your code  as shown below , it helps to locate the files for which code coverage is desired

```
codacy-coverage-reporter -l Java -r PATH_TO_COVERAGE/coverage.xml --prefix PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY 
```

Example

```
codacy-coverage-reporter -l Java -r api/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml --prefix api/src/main/java/
```
